# Hey, I’m Egor Merkushev 👋

iOS developer at since 2011. Now I’m into **agentic workflows**, **specification-driven development**, and building tooling that makes codebases more **structured, verifiable, and AI-friendly**.

## What I care about
- **Specs as first-class artifacts** (PRDs, workplans, executable constraints)
- **Agent-friendly repos** (clear boundaries, tooling, and automation)
- **Verification over vibes** (tests, gates, diagnostics, metrics)
- **Developer experience** that stays sharp even when agents write a lot of code

## My Projects

Here are a few projects I’m actively working on (and excited to share).

1) [0AL — Zero-trust Agents Layer](https://github.com/0al-spec)
A long-term effort to bring **zero-trust principles** to agentic systems: identity, boundaries, and safe execution.

- **0AL org:** https://github.com/0al-spec
- **Agent Passport:** https://github.com/0al-spec/agent-passport  
- **Hypercode:** https://github.com/0al-spec/Hypercode  
- **Hyperprompt**
  - Source: https://github.com/0al-spec/Hyperprompt  
  - Docs: https://0al-spec.github.io/Hyperprompt/documentation/cli  
- **AI/LLM Metrics**
  - Source: https://github.com/0al-spec/Metrics  
  - **SIB (Specification–Implementation Balance) paper (PDF):** https://github.com/0al-spec/Metrics/blob/main/SIB/metrics.pdf  

2) [XcodeMCPWrapper](https://github.com/SoundBlaster/XcodeMCPWrapper)
An **MCP proxy** that makes **Xcode 26.3’s MCP** compatible with **Cursor** and other strict MCP-spec-compliant clients.

3) [Flow — Agentic Workflow](https://github.com/SoundBlaster/Flow)
A practical framework for building **repeatable agent-driven contribution workflows** with clear steps, inputs/outputs, and quality gates.

4) [SpecificationCore](https://github.com/SoundBlaster/SpecificationCore)
A Swift framework implementing the **Specification Pattern** with modern Swift: **property wrappers**, **macros**, and **async/await**.

5) [SpecificationKit](https://github.com/SoundBlaster/SpecificationKit)
Platform-focused integrations and product-level tooling built around **SpecificationCore**.

6) [SpecificationConfig](https://github.com/SoundBlaster/SpecificationConfig)
**Specifications over Swift Configuration** — validation and composition over config models.

8) [ISOInspector](https://github.com/SoundBlaster/ISOInspector)
A complex monorepo: cross-platform **ISO BMFF parser** + **SwiftUI app** (MP4 boxes, tracks, atoms — the fun stuff).

9) [docc2context](https://github.com/SoundBlaster/docc2context)
A **DocC → Markdown** converter for **LLM-readable documentation** (plus a web service WIP).
